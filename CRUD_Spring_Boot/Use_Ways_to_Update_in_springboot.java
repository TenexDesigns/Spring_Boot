In your current code, you have marked the fields in your `BookModel` class with `@NotNull` and `@NotBlank` annotations, which means that these fields cannot be null or blank (empty) when creating a new `BookModel` object. If you want to update a `BookModel` without providing values for all fields (e.g., updating only the title or author without specifying a new value for pages), you might encounter validation errors.

If you want to allow partial updates where some fields are left unchanged, you have a few options:

1. Modify Validation Annotations:
   You can remove the `@NotNull` and `@NotBlank` annotations from the fields that you want to allow to be updated as null or blank. For example:

   ```java
   @Entity
   @NoArgsConstructor
   @Slf4j
   @AllArgsConstructor
   @Table(name = "books")
   public class BookModel {

       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
       private Long id;

       @NotBlank
       @Column(name = "title")
       private String title;

       @NotBlank
       @Column(name = "author")
       private String author;

       @Min(0)
       @Column(name = "pages")
       private int pages;

       // Getters and setters...
   }
   ```

   This way, you can update the `BookModel` object without providing values for all fields.

2. Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):
   Another approach is to use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to update the fields of your entity. In your controller, you can create a DTO class that represents the fields you want to update, and then map the DTO fields to the entity fields before updating. This allows you more flexibility in updating specific fields.

   For example:

   ```java
   @Data
   public class BookUpdateDTO {
       private String title;
       private String author;
       private int pages;
   }
   ```

   In your controller, you can receive the `BookUpdateDTO` object and then update the corresponding fields in your `BookModel` entity.

3. Validation Groups:
   You can also explore validation groups provided by validation frameworks (like Hibernate Validator) to define different sets of validation rules for different scenarios. This way, you can have different validation rules for creating and updating entities.

Choose the approach that best suits your requirements and the level of flexibility you need in updating your `BookModel` objects.
