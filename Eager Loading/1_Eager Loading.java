In Spring Boot (and JPA in general), eager loading refers to fetching associated entities along with the main entity in a single database query. This can help to avoid the N+1 query problem, where retrieving a list of entities results in multiple additional queries to fetch their associated entities.

Eager loading can be achieved using JPA's `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToOne`, and `@ManyToMany` annotations, where you explicitly define how the related entities should be loaded.

Here's how you can achieve eager loading in Spring Boot:

1. **ManyToOne and OneToOne Relationships**:

For `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToOne` relationships, you can use the `fetch` attribute to specify whether to fetch the related entity eagerly or lazily. Eager loading can be achieved using the `FetchType.EAGER` option.

```java
@Entity
public class Order {
    // ...
    
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @JoinColumn(name = "customer_id")
    private Customer customer;

    // ...
}
```

2. **OneToMany and ManyToMany Relationships**:

For `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany` relationships, you can also specify eager loading by setting the `fetch` attribute to `FetchType.EAGER`.

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    // ...
    
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "author", fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private Set<Book> books;

    // ...
}
```

However, it's important to note that using eager loading extensively can lead to performance issues, as it might load more data than necessary. In many cases, it's recommended to use lazy loading (the default behavior) and then explicitly fetch related entities using JPQL queries or Hibernate-specific methods when needed.

3. **Query-based Eager Loading**:

In situations where you want more fine-grained control over eager loading, you can use JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) queries to specify the fetching strategy. This allows you to load specific attributes or related entities based on your needs.

```java
@Repository
public interface OrderRepository extends JpaRepository<Order, Long> {
    @Query("SELECT o FROM Order o JOIN FETCH o.customer WHERE o.id = :orderId")
    Order findOrderWithCustomer(@Param("orderId") Long orderId);
}
```

In this example, the `JOIN FETCH` clause is used to indicate that the `customer` association should be eagerly fetched along with the `Order` entity.

Remember that while eager loading can be beneficial in some scenarios, it's crucial to consider the overall performance impact and potential data over-fetching. In many cases, lazy loading combined with explicit fetching strategies using JPQL might be a more effective approach.
