Yes, in order to use validation annotations in Java, you need to include the necessary dependencies in your project. The most commonly used dependency for validation is Hibernate Validator, which is the reference implementation of the Java Bean Validation API.

To include Hibernate Validator in your project, you can add the following dependency to your build file:

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.2.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:
```groovy
implementation 'org.hibernate.validator:hibernate-validator:6.2.0.Final'
```

This will download the necessary JAR files for Hibernate Validator and its dependencies.

Additionally, you may need to include the appropriate version of the Java Bean Validation API itself. This is typically provided by your Java EE or Jakarta EE container, or you can include it as a separate dependency:

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.validation</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.validation-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:
```groovy
implementation 'jakarta.validation:jakarta.validation-api:3.0.0'
```

Make sure to use the appropriate version of the validation API based on your project's requirements.

Once you have included these dependencies, you should be able to use validation annotations and trigger validation in your code.
