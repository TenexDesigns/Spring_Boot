Yes, to enable validation annotations to work in a Spring Boot application, you need to include the appropriate dependency and configure the validation process. Here are the steps:

1. **Include Validation Dependency**:
   Add the `javax.validation` dependency to your project. In a Maven-based project, you can include it like this in your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>javax.validation</groupId>
       <artifactId>validation-api</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

   For Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   implementation 'javax.validation:validation-api'
   ```

2. **Enable Validation in Spring Boot**:
   By default, Spring Boot auto-configures validation support. However, you need to ensure that your Spring Boot application has the appropriate validation starter dependencies. The starter module includes validation-related configurations.

   If you're using Spring Boot's starter parent, it will include validation by default. If you're manually managing your dependencies, ensure you have the relevant starters like `spring-boot-starter-validation`.

That's it! With these steps, validation annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`, etc., should work in your Spring Boot application.

Remember that the validation errors will be automatically processed by Spring and can be accessed in the `BindingResult` object in your controller methods. You can customize error messages using properties files or annotations in your entity classes.

It's also worth noting that you can create custom validation annotations by combining existing ones or by creating your own custom validation logic using the `javax.validation.Constraint` interface.
