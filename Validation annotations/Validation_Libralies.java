There are several validation libraries that support Spring Boot and can be used to implement validation in your application. Here are some popular ones:

  (My Opnion - Its recommended)
1. Apache Commons Validator: Apache Commons Validator is a library that provides a set of reusable validation routines. It offers various validation rules for common use cases, such as email validation, URL validation, credit card validation, and more.

To use Apache Commons Validator in your Spring Boot application, you need to include the `commons-validator` dependency in your project. You can then use the validation methods provided by the library, such as `EmailValidator`, `UrlValidator`, etc., to perform specific validations.

2. JOI: JOI is a Java library that provides a fluent API for defining validation rules. It allows you to define complex validation rules using a declarative and expressive syntax.

To use JOI in your Spring Boot application, you need to include the `joi` dependency in your project. You can then use the JOI API to define validation rules and validate your data.

3. Hibernate Validator: Hibernate Validator is the reference implementation of the Bean Validation API. It provides a comprehensive set of validation constraints and features. Hibernate Validator is the default validation library used in Spring Boot.

To use Hibernate Validator in your Spring Boot application, you need to include the `spring-boot-starter-validation` dependency in your project. Once the dependency is added, you can use the validation annotations provided by Hibernate Validator, such as `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`, etc., to validate your data.

4. Spring Validation: Spring Framework provides its own validation support through the `spring-context` module. It offers a set of validation annotations, such as `@Valid`, `@NotBlank`, `@Pattern`, etc., that can be used to validate data in Spring Boot applications.

To use Spring Validation, you need to include the `spring-boot-starter-validation` dependency in your project. You can then use the validation annotations provided by Spring, along with the `@Valid` annotation, to trigger the validation process.


These are just a few examples of validation libraries that can be used with Spring Boot. There are many other libraries available, each with its own set of features and capabilities. When choosing a validation library, consider factors such as the complexity of your validation requirements, community support, and integration with Spring Boot.
