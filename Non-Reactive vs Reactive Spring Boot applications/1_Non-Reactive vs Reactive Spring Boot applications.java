Yes, non-reactive Spring Boot applications can definitely scale and be used in microservices architecture. The choice between using reactive or non-reactive paradigm depends on your application's requirements, scalability needs, and the characteristics of your workload.

Non-reactive Spring Boot applications follow the traditional servlet-based approach using Spring MVC. They use blocking I/O and are based on the Java Servlet API. While reactive applications excel in scenarios with high concurrency and asynchronous workloads, non-reactive applications are well-suited for many use cases, especially when existing libraries or systems are not reactive.

Here are a few considerations for using non-reactive Spring Boot applications in microservices:

1. **Scalability**: Non-reactive applications can be scaled horizontally, just like reactive applications. You can deploy multiple instances of your non-reactive microservices to handle increased traffic and load.

2. **Latency**: Non-reactive applications may face higher latency compared to reactive applications under heavy concurrent loads. However, for many applications, the difference in latency might be acceptable.

3. **Resource Usage**: Non-reactive applications typically use more threads for blocking operations. This can impact resource utilization on the server side, especially when the number of concurrent clients increases. Proper thread management and tuning are crucial.

4. **Microservices**: Non-reactive microservices can be part of a microservices architecture. Each microservice can handle specific functionality and communicate with other services through APIs. The choice of reactive or non-reactive depends on the service's requirements.

5. **Interoperability**: Non-reactive microservices can interact with reactive microservices and vice versa. You can choose the paradigm that best fits the specific use case of each microservice.

6. **Existing Codebase**: If you have an existing codebase or libraries that are not designed for reactive programming, it might make sense to stick with non-reactive Spring Boot applications.

It's important to note that while non-reactive applications can be used effectively in microservices, reactive applications are better suited for scenarios where you need to handle a large number of concurrent clients with low resource consumption.

In conclusion, both reactive and non-reactive Spring Boot applications can be used in microservices architecture, depending on your application's requirements and performance characteristics. Consider your workload, concurrency needs, and available resources when deciding between these paradigms.
