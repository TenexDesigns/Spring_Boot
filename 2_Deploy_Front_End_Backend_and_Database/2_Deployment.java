When deploying a web application, there are typically three main components to consider: the frontend, the backend, and the database. Here's how each component is typically handled during deployment:

1. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Source Code: You will deploy the frontend source code, including HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and any assets (images, icons, SVGs, etc.), to a web server or a hosting platform. This can be done using services like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or by configuring a web server like Apache or Nginx.
   - Static Assets: Images, icons, SVGs, and other static assets should also be deployed alongside the frontend code.

2. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Yes, you will also deploy the backend code to a server or a cloud platform. This is necessary because the frontend typically communicates with the backend through API endpoints to retrieve and send data.
   - The backend code should be deployed to a server that is accessible via the internet. Common choices include cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or traditional web hosting services.
   - The backend server should have the necessary runtime environment and dependencies installed to run your Spring Boot application.

3. **Database Deployment**:
   - The approach to database deployment depends on your specific requirements and infrastructure choices:
     - **Database as a Service (DBaaS)**: Some cloud providers offer managed database services (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database) that handle database setup, scaling, and maintenance. You can use these services and do not need to manage the database server yourself.
     - **Self-Managed Database**: If you choose to manage your database server, you will need to set up the database on a server. This often involves installing a database management system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB and configuring it. You can write scripts to create database tables and populate initial data, but this process should be automated and version-controlled.
   - Database credentials and connection information should be securely stored and managed, typically using environment variables or configuration files.

In summary, both the frontend and backend should be deployed to make your web application functional. The database can be deployed as a managed service or self-managed, depending on your infrastructure and scalability requirements. Regardless of the deployment method, it's important to ensure that all components are properly configured and secured for production use. Automating deployment processes, using version control, and following best practices for infrastructure and security are essential for successful deployment and maintenance of your web application.
