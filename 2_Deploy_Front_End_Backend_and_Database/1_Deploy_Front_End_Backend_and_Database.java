When deploying an application, both the frontend and the backend are typically deployed. The backend is the part of the software system that handles data processing, storage, and server-side operations [Source 0](https://blog.back4app.com/how-to-deploy-backend-and-frontend/). The frontend is the part of the software that users interact with directly. The frontend consumes the APIs exposed by the backend to perform operations and display data [Source 3](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-4/front-end-back-end-connection.html).

For deploying the frontend, you can use platforms like Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, or Azure. You need to build your application into a set of static files, which can then be served by these platforms [Source 4](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-your-front-end-app/), [Source 5](https://dev.to/oyetoket/how-to-deploy-your-frontend-application-on-aws-s3-31m9).

Here is an example of how to deploy a frontend application on Netlify:

1. Build your application: If you are using a frontend library like React, Vue, or Angular, you can do this by running `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
2. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
3. Log in to Netlify and click on "New site from Git".
4. Choose your Git provider and select your repository.
5. Set the build command (`npm run build`, `yarn build`, etc.) and the publish directory (usually `build` or `dist`).
6. Click on "Deploy site".

For the backend, you can use platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Azure App Service. These platforms can run your server-side code, expose your APIs, and scale your application as needed [Source 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-backend-application/), [Source 6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/scripts/terraform-secure-backend-frontend), [Source 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/quickstart-code-to-cloud).

Here is an example of how to deploy a Spring Boot backend application on Heroku:

1. Create a `Procfile` in the root directory of your project with the following content: `web: java -jar target/your-jar-file.jar`.
2. Commit your changes and push to a Git repository.
3. Log in to Heroku and create a new app.
4. Under the "Deploy" tab, connect your Git repository and choose the branch to deploy.
5. Click on "Enable Automatic Deploys" if you want Heroku to deploy your app every time you push to the selected branch.
6. Click on "Deploy Branch".

As for the database, there are several ways to handle this. In most cases, the database is hosted on a separate server or a cloud platform like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure SQL Database. You can use the platform's tools to create the database and tables, and then connect to it from your application using the provided connection string [Source 16](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/overview/deployment/visual-studio-web-deployment/preparing-databases), [Source 18](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/data-tier-applications/deploy-a-data-tier-application?view=sql-server-ver16).

For populating the database with data, you can write scripts to create the tables and insert the data. This can be done manually or using database migration tools. Some frameworks like Django and Rails come with their own database migration tools. For Spring Boot, you can use tools like Flyway or Liquibase.

Here's a simple example of a SQL script that creates a table and inserts data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(30),
    Email VARCHAR(30)
);

INSERT INTO Users (ID, Name, Email)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'),
       (2, 'Jane Doe', 'jane.doe@example.com');

    Yes, you need to deploy both the frontend and backend code when deploying a web application. The frontend code is responsible for rendering the user interface, while the backend code is responsible for handling the application logic and data.

The database can also be deployed, but it is not always necessary. If you are using a cloud-based database, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), then you can simply create the database and tables in the cloud. However, if you are using a local database, then you will need to deploy the database along with the rest of the application.

Here are the steps involved in deploying a web application:

1. Create a deployment plan. This plan should include the following:
    * The deployment environment, such as a cloud-based platform or a local server.
    * The deployment process, such as how the code will be transferred to the deployment environment.
    * The deployment tools, such as a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.
2. Deploy the frontend code. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as a content delivery network (CDN) or a web server.
3. Deploy the backend code. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as a cloud-based platform or a local server.
4. Deploy the database. If necessary, deploy the database along with the rest of the application.
5. Test the application. Once the application is deployed, you should test it to make sure that it is working properly.

I hope this helps!
