When deploying an application, both the frontend and the backend are typically deployed. The backend is the part of the software system that handles data processing, storage, and server-side operations [Source 0](https://blog.back4app.com/how-to-deploy-backend-and-frontend/). The frontend is the part of the software that users interact with directly. The frontend consumes the APIs exposed by the backend to perform operations and display data [Source 3](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-4/front-end-back-end-connection.html).

For deploying the frontend, you can use platforms like Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, or Azure. You need to build your application into a set of static files, which can then be served by these platforms [Source 4](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-your-front-end-app/), [Source 5](https://dev.to/oyetoket/how-to-deploy-your-frontend-application-on-aws-s3-31m9).

Here is an example of how to deploy a frontend application on Netlify:

1. Build your application: If you are using a frontend library like React, Vue, or Angular, you can do this by running `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
2. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
3. Log in to Netlify and click on "New site from Git".
4. Choose your Git provider and select your repository.
5. Set the build command (`npm run build`, `yarn build`, etc.) and the publish directory (usually `build` or `dist`).
6. Click on "Deploy site".

For the backend, you can use platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Azure App Service. These platforms can run your server-side code, expose your APIs, and scale your application as needed [Source 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-backend-application/), [Source 6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/scripts/terraform-secure-backend-frontend), [Source 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/quickstart-code-to-cloud).

Here is an example of how to deploy a Spring Boot backend application on Heroku:

1. Create a `Procfile` in the root directory of your project with the following content: `web: java -jar target/your-jar-file.jar`.
2. Commit your changes and push to a Git repository.
3. Log in to Heroku and create a new app.
4. Under the "Deploy" tab, connect your Git repository and choose the branch to deploy.
5. Click on "Enable Automatic Deploys" if you want Heroku to deploy your app every time you push to the selected branch.
6. Click on "Deploy Branch".

As for the database, there are several ways to handle this. In most cases, the database is hosted on a separate server or a cloud platform like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure SQL Database. You can use the platform's tools to create the database and tables, and then connect to it from your application using the provided connection string [Source 16](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/overview/deployment/visual-studio-web-deployment/preparing-databases), [Source 18](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/data-tier-applications/deploy-a-data-tier-application?view=sql-server-ver16).

For populating the database with data, you can write scripts to create the tables and insert the data. This can be done manually or using database migration tools. Some frameworks like Django and Rails come with their own database migration tools. For Spring Boot, you can use tools like Flyway or Liquibase.

Here's a simple example of a SQL script that creates a table and inserts data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(30),
    Email VARCHAR(30)
);

INSERT INTO Users (ID, Name, Email)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'),
       (2, 'Jane Doe', 'jane.doe@example.com');
```

This script can be run using a SQL client or a database management tool. Please refer to the documentation of your database system for the exact commands and tools to use [Source 20](https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/web/mysql-webapp.html).
