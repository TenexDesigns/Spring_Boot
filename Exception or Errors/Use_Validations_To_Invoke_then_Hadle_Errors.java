You're correct that the current condition is quite specific to checking only the `firstName` field, and there can be various other conditions that might lead to a bad request. To handle a broader range of invalid input scenarios, you can implement more comprehensive validation. The Spring Framework provides validation support through the `javax.validation` package annotations, which you can utilize to handle these cases more gracefully.

Here's how you can improve your code to handle more general cases of invalid input:

1. **Use Validation Annotations**:
   Annotate your `Employee` class with validation annotations from the `javax.validation.constraints` package to specify constraints on the fields.

   ```java
   import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;
   import javax.validation.constraints.Size;

   @Entity
   @Table(name = "employees")
   public class Employee {

       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
       private Long id;

       @NotNull
       @Size(min = 1, max = 255)
       @Column(name = "first_name")
       private String firstName;

       @NotNull
       @Size(min = 1, max = 255)
       @Column(name = "last_name")
       private String lastName;

       @NotNull
       @Size(min = 1, max = 255)
       @Column(name = "email_id")
       private String emailId;

       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

2. **Use `@Valid` Annotation in Controller**:
   Annotate the `@RequestBody` parameter with `@Valid` in your controller method to trigger validation.

   ```java
   @PostMapping("/employees")
   public ResponseEntity<String> createResource(@Valid @RequestBody Employee employee) {
       Employee savedEmployee = employeeRepository.save(employee);
       return ResponseEntity.ok("Resource created successfully");
   }
   ```

By using validation annotations, you can ensure that the fields meet the specified criteria (such as not being null and having a specific size). If the data doesn't meet these criteria, Spring will automatically throw a `MethodArgumentNotValidException` with details about the validation errors.

To handle this exception globally and provide custom error messages, you can use the `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations, as mentioned earlier. This way, you can handle various validation errors in a centralized manner and return appropriate error responses to the client.
