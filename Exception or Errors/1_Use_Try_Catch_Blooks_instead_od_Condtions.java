I apologize for the confusion. You're right, the condition `savedEmployee == null` might not be correct, as the `save` method of a repository usually doesn't return `null` even if the saving operation fails.

In that case, you can use the `save` method's return value to determine if the employee was saved successfully. The `save` method should return the saved entity with its `id` set if the operation was successful, or it might throw an exception if the operation fails.

Here's how you can adjust your code to handle this situation more accurately:

```java
@PostMapping("/employees")
public ResponseEntity<String> createResource(@RequestBody Employee employee) {
    try {
        Employee savedEmployee = employeeRepository.save(employee);
        // Logic to create resource

        return ResponseEntity.ok("Resource created successfully");
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        throw new BadRequestException("Failed to create employee");
    }
}
```

In this code, if the `save` operation encounters an exception (which usually indicates a failure), the catch block will be executed, and you can throw your `BadRequestException` indicating the failure to create the employee.

Remember to adjust the exception type (`Exception` in this example) based on what type of exception the `save` method might throw in your specific setup. This will ensure you handle the situation correctly whether the `save` operation fails due to database issues or any other reasons.
