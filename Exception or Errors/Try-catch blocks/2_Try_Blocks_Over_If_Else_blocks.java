**When to Use Try-Catch Blocks Over If-Else Statements**

Try-catch blocks are used when dealing with exceptional situations, i.e., situations that are unexpected and might lead to program failure. They are different from if-else statements, which deal with logical control flow based on conditions.

Use try-catch blocks when:

1. Dealing with operations that might throw checked exceptions (IO, network operations, etc.).
2. Handling exceptions caused by external factors or APIs that your code interacts with.
3. You want to handle exceptions gracefully without crashing the application.
4. You want to capture detailed information about the exception for logging or reporting.

Use if-else statements when:

1. You need to make decisions based on logical conditions.
2. Handling different branches of code execution based on the result of conditions.
3. You want to guide the flow of your program based on certain criteria.

In essence, try-catch blocks are for handling exceptional situations, while if-else statements are for managing logical control flow. Often, they are used together to provide comprehensive error handling and control flow management in your application.
