The `Optional<T>` type in Java is used to represent an object that might be present or might be absent. It's a way to handle cases where you want to indicate the absence of a value explicitly, without resorting to using `null`.

In the context of Spring Data JPA, the `findById` method returns an `Optional<T>`. This is because not all IDs will necessarily have a corresponding entity in the database. By using `Optional`, you are being prompted to explicitly handle both cases: the presence of an entity (which is wrapped in the `Optional`), and the absence of an entity.

The `Optional` type is designed to encourage developers to consider these two possibilities and avoid null pointer exceptions. It provides methods like `isPresent()` and `orElse()` to handle these cases.

Here's an example of how you can use `Optional` to throw a `ResourceNotFoundException` if the resource is not found:

```java
public class EmployeeService {
    public Employee findById(Long id) {
        Optional<Employee> optionalEmployee = employeeRepository.findById(id);

        if (optionalEmployee.isPresent()) {
            return optionalEmployee.get();
        } else {
            throw new ResourceNotFoundException("Employee of id " + id + " not found");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, you're checking whether the `Optional` is present using the `isPresent()` method. If it's present, you retrieve the employee using `get()`. If it's not present, you throw a `ResourceNotFoundException`.

Alternatively, you can use the `orElseThrow()` method, which is more concise and directly throws the exception if the `Optional` is empty:

```java
public class EmployeeService {
    public Employee findById(Long id) {
        return employeeRepository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Employee of id " + id + " not found"));
    }
}
```

The key takeaway here is that using `Optional` allows you to explicitly handle the case where a resource might not be found without relying on `null` values, which can often lead to NullPointerExceptions. It provides a more intuitive and safer way to handle the absence of values.
