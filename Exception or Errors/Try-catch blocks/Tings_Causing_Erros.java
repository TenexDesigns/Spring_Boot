Correct, in the provided code snippet, you don't need to use a try-catch block because you are directly handling the absence of the resource using the `Optional` and throwing a custom exception when necessary. Try-catch blocks are not needed in this specific scenario.

Try-catch blocks in Spring Boot (or any Java application) are used to handle exceptions when they occur during the execution of your code. They are used when you expect certain exceptional conditions to arise, and you want to gracefully recover from those conditions without causing the entire application to crash.

Here are some scenarios where try-catch blocks find their use in Spring Boot:

1. **External Services and IO Operations**: When interacting with external services (like APIs or databases) or performing IO operations (reading/writing files), exceptions might occur due to network issues, database connectivity problems, file not found, etc. Try-catch blocks help you handle these situations and provide appropriate error handling or fallback mechanisms.

2. **Data Processing and Transformation**: If your application processes data and transformations, unexpected data format issues might arise. Try-catch blocks can help you catch these errors and provide fallback or error reporting.

3. **Third-Party Libraries**: When using third-party libraries, especially those that are not well-documented or maintained, try-catch blocks can catch exceptions thrown by those libraries and provide better error handling.

4. **Concurrency and Multi-Threading**: In multi-threaded environments, exceptions can arise due to race conditions or thread interference. Try-catch blocks help you capture these exceptions and manage thread-related issues.

5. **Validation and Input**: While Spring Boot provides validation mechanisms, there might be cases where you want to implement custom validation and handle errors using try-catch blocks.

6. **Custom Logic and Business Rules**: If you have specific business rules that can lead to exceptional conditions, try-catch blocks can be used to handle these situations gracefully.

Remember that try-catch blocks should be used where you can take meaningful action to recover from the exception or provide appropriate error handling. In some cases, it might be better to let exceptions propagate up the call stack if you don't have a suitable way to handle them at a particular level. Additionally, when throwing custom exceptions like `ResourceNotFoundException` or other domain-specific exceptions, you don't always need try-catch blocks if you're handling these exceptions elsewhere in the application using global exception handlers or similar mechanisms.
