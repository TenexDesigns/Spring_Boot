Some common errors include

- BadRequestException: For cases where the client's request is malformed or invalid.
- UnauthorizedException: When a request requires authentication or authorization, but the client isn't authenticated or authorized.
- ForbiddenException: Similar to UnauthorizedException, but used when the client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
- InternalServerErrorException: For unexpected server errors that aren't specifically handled by other custom exceptions.
- MethodNotAllowedException: When a client uses an HTTP method that is not allowed for the requested resource.



Sure, I'll provide you with code examples for each of the custom exceptions you mentioned and show how to use them in a Spring Boot RESTful API backend project.

1. **BadRequestException**:

BadRequestException: For cases where the client's request is malformed or invalid.
  

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
public class BadRequestException extends RuntimeException {

    public BadRequestException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

Usage in a controller:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class MyController {

    @PostMapping("/resource")
    public ResponseEntity<String> createResource(@RequestBody Resource resource) {
        if (resource == null || resource.getName() == null) {
            throw new BadRequestException("Invalid resource data");
        }
        // Logic to create resource
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Resource created successfully");
    }
}
```

2. **UnauthorizedException**:
UnauthorizedException: When a request requires authentication or authorization, but the client isn't authenticated or authorized.
  

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED)
public class UnauthorizedException extends RuntimeException {

    public UnauthorizedException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

Usage in a service:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    public void performAuthorizedAction() {
        if (!userIsAuthorized()) {
            throw new UnauthorizedException("You are not authorized for this action");
        }
        // Logic to perform authorized action
    }
}
```

3. **ForbiddenException**:
ForbiddenException: Similar to UnauthorizedException, but used when the client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
  

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)
public class ForbiddenException extends RuntimeException {

    public ForbiddenException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

Usage in a controller:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/resource/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getResource(@PathVariable Long id) {
        if (!userHasPermission(id)) {
            throw new ForbiddenException("You don't have permission to access this resource");
        }
        // Logic to get resource
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Resource data");
    }
}
```

4. **InternalServerErrorException**:

InternalServerErrorException: For unexpected server errors that aren't specifically handled by other custom exceptions.
  

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
public class InternalServerErrorException extends RuntimeException {

    public InternalServerErrorException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

Usage in a service:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    public void performCriticalOperation() {
        try {
            // Logic that may result in unexpected errors
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            throw new InternalServerErrorException("An unexpected error occurred");
        }
    }
}
```

5. **MethodNotAllowedException**:

MethodNotAllowedException: When a client uses an HTTP method that is not allowed for the requested resource.
  

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED)
public class MethodNotAllowedException extends RuntimeException {

    public MethodNotAllowedException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

Usage in a controller:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class MyController {

    @RequestMapping(value = "/resource", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ResponseEntity<String> getResource() {
        throw new MethodNotAllowedException("GET method not allowed for this resource");
    }

    @RequestMapping(value = "/resource", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public ResponseEntity<String> createResource(@RequestBody Resource resource) {
        throw new MethodNotAllowedException("POST method not allowed for this resource");
    }
}
```



Certainly, there are many more HTTP status codes and corresponding error scenarios that you might encounter in a RESTful API. Here are a few additional error scenarios and their corresponding exceptions:

1. **ConflictException** (409 Conflict):
   Indicates that the requested action cannot be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CONFLICT)
public class ConflictException extends RuntimeException {

    public ConflictException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

2. **NotFoundException** (404 Not Found):
   Indicates that the requested resource could not be found.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class NotFoundException extends RuntimeException {

    public NotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

3. **UnsupportedMediaTypeException** (415 Unsupported Media Type):
   Indicates that the media type of the request body is not supported by the server.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE)
public class UnsupportedMediaTypeException extends RuntimeException {

    public UnsupportedMediaTypeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

4. **ServiceUnavailableException** (503 Service Unavailable):
   Indicates that the server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE)
public class ServiceUnavailableException extends RuntimeException {

    public ServiceUnavailableException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

5. **BadRequestException** (400 Bad Request):
   For cases where the client's request is malformed or invalid.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
public class BadRequestException extends RuntimeException {

    public BadRequestException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

6. **UnauthorizedException** (401 Unauthorized):
   When a request requires authentication or authorization, but the client isn't authenticated or authorized.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED)
public class UnauthorizedException extends RuntimeException {

    public UnauthorizedException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

7. **ForbiddenException** (403 Forbidden):
   Similar to UnauthorizedException, but used when the client does not have permission to access the requested resource.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)
public class ForbiddenException extends RuntimeException {

    public ForbiddenException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many possible exceptions you might encounter in a RESTful API. The choice of exceptions depends on your application's business logic and the specific error scenarios you want to handle gracefully. Custom exceptions with meaningful error messages help improve the clarity of your API responses and enhance the overall user experience.

  



  Certainly, there are several more HTTP status codes that represent different error scenarios in a RESTful API. Here are a few additional status codes and the corresponding error scenarios:

1. **RequestTimeoutException** (408 Request Timeout):
   Indicates that the server did not receive a complete request within the time the server was prepared to wait.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.REQUEST_TIMEOUT)
public class RequestTimeoutException extends RuntimeException {

    public RequestTimeoutException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

2. **UnsupportedOperationException** (501 Not Implemented):
   Indicates that the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_IMPLEMENTED)
public class UnsupportedOperationException extends RuntimeException {

    public UnsupportedOperationException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

3. **GatewayTimeoutException** (504 Gateway Timeout):
   Indicates that an intermediate proxy or gateway did not receive a timely response from an upstream server or some other auxiliary server it needed to access in order to complete the request.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.GATEWAY_TIMEOUT)
public class GatewayTimeoutException extends RuntimeException {

    public GatewayTimeoutException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

4. **ConflictException** (409 Conflict):
   Indicates that the requested action cannot be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CONFLICT)
public class ConflictException extends RuntimeException {

    public ConflictException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

5. **UnprocessableEntityException** (422 Unprocessable Entity):
   Indicates that the server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct, but it was unable to process the contained instructions.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)
public class UnprocessableEntityException extends RuntimeException {

    public UnprocessableEntityException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

6. **TooManyRequestsException** (429 Too Many Requests):
   Indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS)
public class TooManyRequestsException extends RuntimeException {

    public TooManyRequestsException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

Remember that the choice of which exceptions to use depends on your application's requirements and business logic. It's important to provide meaningful error messages and handle different scenarios gracefully to enhance the user experience when interacting with your RESTful API.

































Remember, these are just simple examples to illustrate the concept. In a real application, you might want to include more context-specific error messages and handle exceptions more gracefully, such as by returning JSON error responses with detailed information. Additionally, you can create base exception classes to better organize your code and provide consistent error handling across your project.
