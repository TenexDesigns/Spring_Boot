my ide is giving me this error "Condition 'savedEmployee == null' is always 'false' "

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your IDE is correct. In Spring Data JPA, the `save()` method should never return `null`. If the save operation fails, it will throw an exception, not return `null`. 

So, you don't need to check if `savedEmployee` is `null`. Instead, you should handle exceptions that might be thrown during the save operation. 

Here's an example of how you can handle `DataIntegrityViolationException`, which is thrown when a database constraint is violated:

```java
@PostMapping("/employees")
public ResponseEntity<String> createResource(@RequestBody Employee employee) {
    try {
        Employee savedEmployee = employeeRepository.save(employee);
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Resource created successfully");
    } catch (DataIntegrityViolationException ex) {
        throw new BadRequestException("Failed to create resource: " + ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this code, if the `save()` operation fails due to a database constraint violation, a `BadRequestException` is thrown with a message that includes the original exception message.

You can add more `catch` blocks to handle other exceptions as needed.

Let me know if you have any further questions!
