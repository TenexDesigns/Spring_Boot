-------------------------------------------------------

  The `ResourceNotFoundException` class you provided is a custom exception class that's designed to handle cases where a requested resource is not found. In a Spring Boot RESTful backend project (or any application dealing with APIs), custom exceptions like this are helpful for providing more meaningful and context-specific error messages to clients.

Let's break down its purpose and usage:

1. **Purpose of `ResourceNotFoundException`**:
   The purpose of this custom exception is to handle scenarios where a client sends a request for a resource (like a user, an item, etc.), but the requested resource does not exist in the system. Instead of throwing a generic exception, such as `RuntimeException`, using a custom exception like `ResourceNotFoundException` allows you to signal to the client that the requested resource was not found.

2. **Exception Package**:
   The exception package (or package structure) is used to organize and manage different types of exceptions in your project. This helps in keeping your codebase organized and makes it easier to locate and manage exceptions as your project grows.

3. **Other Exception Types to Watch Out For**:
   Besides `ResourceNotFoundException`, there are many other exception types that can occur in a Spring Boot RESTful backend project. Some common ones include:
   
   - `BadRequestException`: For cases where the clients request is malformed or invalid.
   - `UnauthorizedException`: When a request requires authentication or authorization, but the client isnt authenticated or authorized.
   - `ForbiddenException`: Similar to `UnauthorizedException`, but used when the client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
   - `InternalServerErrorException`: For unexpected server errors that arent specifically handled by other custom exceptions.
   - `MethodNotAllowedException`: When a client uses an HTTP method that is not allowed for the requested resource.

4. **How the Exception File Works**:
   The `ResourceNotFoundException` class is a subclass of `RuntimeException`, which means its an unchecked exception. This allows you to throw it without explicitly catching it or declaring it in the method signature. The `@ResponseStatus` annotation with `HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND` indicates that when this exception is thrown, the HTTP response status code should be set to 404 (Not Found).

5. **Using the Exception in RESTful Web API**:
   In your RESTful API controllers or service classes, you can catch and throw this custom exception when needed. For instance, when you're retrieving a resource, if the resource is not found in the database, you can throw a `ResourceNotFoundException` like this:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/resource/{id}")
    public Resource getResource(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Resource resource = getResourceFromDatabase(id);
        if (resource == null) {
            throw new ResourceNotFoundException("Resource with ID " + id + " not found");
        }
        return resource;
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```

In this example, if the `getResourceFromDatabase` method returns `null`, the custom exception will be thrown, and the client will receive an HTTP response with a 404 status code and the specified error message.

Custom exceptions like `ResourceNotFoundException` improve the readability of your code, make error handling more consistent, and provide more meaningful information to clients interacting with your RESTful API.
