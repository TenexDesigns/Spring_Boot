Lazy loading is a technique used in Spring Boot (and JPA in general) to defer the loading of associated entities until they are explicitly accessed. This can help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary database queries when retrieving the main entity.

In JPA, lazy loading is the default behavior for most relationships, meaning that associated entities are not fetched from the database until they are accessed. However, you can explicitly specify lazy loading using annotations to reinforce this behavior.

Here's how you can achieve lazy loading in Spring Boot:

1. **ManyToOne and OneToOne Relationships**:

For `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToOne` relationships, lazy loading is the default behavior. However, you can explicitly specify it for clarity, although it's not required:

```java
@Entity
public class Order {
    // ...
    
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "customer_id")
    private Customer customer;

    // ...
}
```

2. **OneToMany and ManyToMany Relationships**:

For `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany` relationships, lazy loading is also the default behavior. You can explicitly specify it like this:

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    // ...
    
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "author", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Set<Book> books;

    // ...
}
```

3. **Fetching Associated Entities**:

When you access a lazily loaded association, Hibernate will trigger a database query to fetch the associated data. For example, if you access the `books` association in the `Author` entity:

```java
Author author = authorRepository.findById(authorId).orElseThrow(...);
Set<Book> books = author.getBooks(); // This triggers the lazy loading query
```

Hibernate will issue a separate query to load the associated books when the `getBooks()` method is called.

It's important to note that lazy loading should be used thoughtfully. While it can help reduce unnecessary data fetching and improve performance, it can also lead to unexpected behavior if not managed properly. Common issues like "LazyInitializationException" can occur if you try to access lazy-loaded associations outside the context of an active persistence session.

To mitigate these issues, you can use techniques like:

- **Open Session In View (OSIV)**: A Spring interceptor that keeps the Hibernate session open until the view rendering is complete. This way, lazy loading can still work within the view.

- **DTO Projections**: When you want to selectively fetch related entities, you can use DTO projections to retrieve only the required data.

- **Fetch Join**: Using JPQL queries with fetch joins allows you to fetch related entities eagerly for a specific use case without altering the default lazy loading behavior.

Lazy loading is a powerful feature that helps optimize database queries, but it requires careful consideration to ensure the best performance and behavior in your Spring Boot application.
