The annotations `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, and `@Column` are part of the Java Persistence API (JPA) which is used for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). They define how your Java classes and their fields map to database tables and columns. Let's break down each annotation's purpose in the context of your `Book` class:

1. `@Entity`:
   The `@Entity` annotation is used to mark a class as a JPA entity. An entity represents a table in the database. In your case, the `Book` class is being treated as an entity, and instances of this class will be persisted in a corresponding database table.

2. `@Table(name = "employees")`:
   The `@Table` annotation allows you to specify the name of the database table associated with the entity. In this case, the `Book` entity is mapped to a table named "employees" in the database.

3. `@Id`:
   The `@Id` annotation indicates that the field to which it is applied is the primary key of the entity. In your case, the `id` field is marked as the primary key of the `Book` entity.

4. `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`:
   The `@GeneratedValue` annotation is used to specify how the primary key values are generated. In this case, you are using the `GenerationType.IDENTITY` strategy, which means that the primary key values are generated by an identity column in the database. This is typically used for auto-incrementing primary keys.

5. `@Column(name = "first_name")` and similar annotations:
   The `@Column` annotation is used to specify the mapping of the annotated field to a database column. It allows you to customize the column name, data type, length, and other attributes. In your example, you're specifying the column names for `firstName`, `lastName`, and `emailId`.

In summary, these annotations are used to define the mapping between your Java class (`Book` in this case) and a corresponding database table. They specify the primary key, column names, and how primary key values are generated. This allows you to work with Java objects in your application code while seamlessly persisting and retrieving data in a relational database using JPA.

Certainly! Lets walk through an example of using the Java Persistence API (JPA) for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in building a simple RESTful API using Spring Boot. We'll create a basic API to manage a collection of `Book` entities.

1. **Entity Class Definition**:
   Let's start by defining the `Book` entity class using JPA annotations.

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Table(name = "books")
public class Book {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;
    private String author;

    // Getters and setters...
}
```

2. **Repository Interface**:
   Create a repository interface that extends `JpaRepository` from Spring Data JPA. This interface provides basic CRUD operations for the `Book` entity.

```java
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface BookRepository extends JpaRepository<Book, Long> {
}
```

3. **Service Class**:
   Create a service class to interact with the repository and perform business logic if needed.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.util.List;

@Service
public class BookService {

    private final BookRepository bookRepository;

    @Autowired
    public BookService(BookRepository bookRepository) {
        this.bookRepository = bookRepository;
    }

    public List<Book> getAllBooks() {
        return bookRepository.findAll();
    }

    public Book getBookById(Long id) {
        return bookRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
    }

    public Book createOrUpdateBook(Book book) {
        return bookRepository.save(book);
    }

    public void deleteBook(Long id) {
        bookRepository.deleteById(id);
    }
}
```

4. **Controller Class**:
   Create a controller class to handle incoming HTTP requests and interact with the service.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/books")
public class BookController {

    private final BookService bookService;

    @Autowired
    public BookController(BookService bookService) {
        this.bookService = bookService;
    }

    @GetMapping
    public List<Book> getAllBooks() {
        return bookService.getAllBooks();
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Book getBookById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return bookService.getBookById(id);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Book createBook(@RequestBody Book book) {
        return bookService.createOrUpdateBook(book);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public Book updateBook(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Book book) {
        book.setId(id);
        return bookService.createOrUpdateBook(book);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteBook(@PathVariable Long id) {
        bookService.deleteBook(id);
    }
}
```

In this example, we've created a simple RESTful API for managing `Book` entities. JPA handles the mapping between the `Book` class and the underlying database table, and the Spring Data JPA repository provides convenient methods for interacting with the database. The service layer contains business logic, and the controller handles HTTP requests and responses.

Remember that in a real-world scenario, you would need to configure your Spring Boot application, set up the database connection, and manage transactional boundaries. Additionally, you would need to handle error responses, validation, and potentially other advanced features.

This example illustrates how JPA can be used for ORM in a Spring Boot RESTful API project, enabling you to work with Java objects while seamlessly interacting with a relational database.
