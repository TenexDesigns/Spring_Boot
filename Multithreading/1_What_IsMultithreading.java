Multithreading in Java refers to the capability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently, allowing it to perform multiple tasks in parallel. Each thread represents an independent flow of execution within the same process, sharing the same memory space. Multithreading is used to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of applications by utilizing the available CPU resources effectively.

**Where and When is Multithreading Used**:
1. **Concurrency**: Multithreading is used to achieve concurrency, allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously, such as handling multiple requests in a web server or processing data concurrently.

2. **Responsiveness**: In applications with user interfaces, multithreading can keep the user interface responsive while performing heavy tasks in the background.

3. **Parallelism**: Multithreading enables parallelism, where multiple tasks are performed simultaneously on multiple cores of a CPU, leading to improved performance in CPU-bound tasks.

4. **I/O Operations**: Multithreading is useful for I/O-bound operations, such as reading/writing files or making network requests. While one thread is waiting for I/O, other threads can continue processing.

**Using Multithreading in Spring Boot**:
Spring Boot applications can definitely utilize multithreading. The Spring Framework provides support for multithreading through various means, including:

1. Using the `@Async` annotation: Spring's `@Async` annotation allows methods to be executed asynchronously in a separate thread pool. This is useful for tasks that don't need to block the main application thread.

2. Using the `TaskExecutor` interface: Spring provides implementations of the `TaskExecutor` interface, like `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor`, which can be configured to manage and execute asynchronous tasks.

**Applications and Common Problems**:
Common applications of multithreading in Spring Boot include:
- Handling concurrent requests in web applications.
- Parallelizing data processing tasks.
- Managing background tasks without affecting the main application thread.

Common problems and challenges in multithreading include:
- Thread synchronization: Ensuring threads cooperate and share data safely to avoid race conditions and data corruption.
- Deadlocks: Situations where two or more threads are unable to proceed because they're each waiting for a resource held by another thread.
- Thread contention: Threads competing for resources, which can lead to decreased performance.
- Oversubscription: Creating more threads than the available CPU cores, which can lead to inefficiencies.

**Key Terms and Terminologies**:
- Thread: A lightweight unit of execution within a process.
- Runnable: An interface representing a task that can be executed by a thread.
- Thread Pool: A collection of threads that can be used to execute tasks concurrently.
- Race Condition: A situation where multiple threads access shared resources concurrently and produce unexpected results due to improper synchronization.
- Synchronization: Mechanisms to control the access to shared resources by multiple threads to prevent data corruption.
- Lock: A synchronization mechanism used to control thread access to a resource.
- Monitor: An object used to synchronize access to a block of code.
