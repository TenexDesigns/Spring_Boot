To run your Flyway migration scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Configuration**:
   Ensure you have Flyway properly configured in your project. This usually involves adding the Flyway dependency to your build configuration (e.g., Maven or Gradle) and configuring the database connection properties in your application configuration.

2. **Directory Structure**:
   Make sure your Flyway migration scripts are placed in the correct directory structure. By default, Flyway expects migration scripts to be located in the `src/main/resources/db/migration` directory.

3. **Run the Application**:
   Once your application is running (e.g., by starting your Spring Boot application), Flyway will automatically detect and execute the migration scripts during the application's startup.

Flyway follows a version-based naming convention for migration scripts. For example, if your script is named `V1__create_table.sql`, the `V1` part indicates the version of the migration script. Flyway keeps track of which scripts have been executed and ensures that only new scripts are executed.

If you're using Spring Boot, you can customize Flyway's behavior through application properties. For example:

- `spring.flyway.enabled`: Set to `true` (default) to enable Flyway migration.
- `spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate`: Set to `true` to perform baseline migration (useful when starting with an existing database).
- `spring.flyway.locations`: Specifies additional locations for migration scripts (comma-separated).

Remember that Flyway migrations should be idempotent, meaning they can be executed multiple times without causing issues. This is important for maintaining consistency when different instances of your application run the migrations concurrently.

For example, your `db/migration/V1__create_table.sql` might look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

When you start your Spring Boot application, Flyway will automatically detect and execute this migration script, creating the "users" table in your database.

Keep in mind that these instructions are based on standard practices, but actual steps might vary depending on your project's configuration and setup. Always refer to the official documentation of Flyway and your specific framework (e.g., Spring Boot) for precise details.
