The error message you're encountering indicates that Flyway's migration file naming convention is not being followed. Flyway expects migration script filenames to adhere to a specific pattern in order to apply them correctly. The naming convention is typically V{version}__{description}.sql, where {version} is a unique version number and {description} is a short description of the migration.
  



The error message indicates that the migration file does not follow the Flyway naming convention. Flyway expects the migration files to follow a specific naming pattern: `V<VERSION>__<DESCRIPTION>.sql`.

In your case, the filename `v1_create_employee_table.sql` does not follow this convention because it lacks the double underscore (`__`) between the version number and the description.

To fix this issue, rename your file to `V1__Create_Employee_Table.sql`. The version number (`1` in this case) should be followed by two underscores and then the description of the migration (`Create_Employee_Table` in this case). The description should not contain any spaces.

After renaming the file, try running your Spring Boot application again. Flyway should now be able to detect and apply the migration correctly.

Let me know if you have any further questions!
