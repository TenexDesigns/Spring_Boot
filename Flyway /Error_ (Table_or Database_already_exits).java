The error message you're encountering indicates that the migration script is attempting to create a table that already exists in the database. This can happen if the initial migration script was executed previously, and the database now already contains the "employees" table.

To avoid this error, you can consider the following options:

1. **Drop and Recreate Schema (Only for Development)**:
   If you're in a development environment and don't have critical data in the database, you can drop and recreate the schema. This can be done by configuring Flyway to clean the database and then applying the migrations again. Be cautious when using this approach in production, as it will result in data loss.

2. **Add a Conditional Check**:
   In your migration script, you can add a conditional check before creating the table. You can use SQL's `IF NOT EXISTS` syntax to only create the table if it doesn't already exist. Here's an example:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       email_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. **Skip Initial Migration**:
   If the table already exists and you're sure that it matches the expected structure, you can skip running the initial migration by altering its version number. For example, rename `V1__Create_Employee_Table.sql` to `V0__Create_Employee_Table.sql`, so Flyway will consider it as a baseline script that is already applied.

4. **Version Control in Production**:
   In a production environment, be careful when making changes to migrations that have already been executed. Avoid making changes to scripts that have been applied to a production database to prevent issues like data loss.

Remember to choose the approach that best fits your situation and development workflow. It's important to consider the impact of each option on your data and the state of your database.
