Learning Spring Boot to create REST APIs is a great idea, as it's a popular framework that simplifies the development of Java-based applications. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Java Basics**: Make sure you have a solid understanding of Java programming fundamentals, including classes, objects, methods, inheritance, and basic syntax.

2. **Maven or Gradle**: Spring Boot projects are usually managed using build tools like Maven or Gradle. Familiarize yourself with either of these tools, as they help manage project dependencies and build processes.

3. **RESTful Architecture**: Understand the basics of REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture. Learn about HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, and URL structure for creating RESTful APIs.

4. **Spring Framework Basics**: Before diving into Spring Boot, have a basic understanding of the core concepts of the Spring Framework, such as Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).

5. **Spring Boot Introduction**: Learn about the features and advantages of Spring Boot. It simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring applications, reducing boilerplate code.

6. **Project Setup**: Set up your development environment with Spring Boot. You can use Spring Initializr to generate a basic Spring Boot project structure. Select the necessary dependencies like "Spring Web" for creating REST APIs.

7. **Controller**: Understand how to create a REST controller using Spring's `@RestController` annotation. Controllers handle incoming requests and provide responses.

8. **RequestMapping**: Learn how to map URL patterns to controller methods using annotations like `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

9. **Request and Response Handling**: Learn how to handle request parameters, request bodies, headers, and cookies. Also, understand how to create meaningful responses with appropriate status codes and response bodies.

10. **Data Models**: Understand how to define data models using Java classes. These models represent the data you'll work with in your REST API.

11. **Service Layer**: Implement a service layer that separates business logic from the controller. This enhances code modularity and maintainability.

12. **Data Access**: Learn how to use Spring Data JPA or other data access methods to interact with databases. This involves creating repositories and using CRUD operations.

13. **Exception Handling**: Learn how to handle exceptions that might occur during API operations. This includes using `@ExceptionHandler` to handle different types of exceptions and returning appropriate error responses.

14. **Validation**: Implement request validation to ensure that incoming data is valid before processing it.

15. **Security (Optional)**: If your application requires security, learn about Spring Security to handle authentication and authorization.

16. **Testing**: Explore unit testing using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito. Write tests for your controllers, services, and other components to ensure their correctness.

17. **Documentation**: Consider adding API documentation using tools like Swagger or Springfox. This helps developers understand how to use your API.

18. **Deployment**: Learn how to package your Spring Boot application as a JAR or WAR file and deploy it to a server.

19. **Advanced Topics**: As you become more comfortable, explore more advanced topics like caching, asynchronous programming, microservices, and more.

20. **Practice**: The best way to learn is by doing. Start with small projects and gradually work on more complex ones.

Remember that learning Spring Boot is a journey, and it's okay to take your time to grasp each concept thoroughly. The Spring Boot documentation, online tutorials, and community forums can be valuable resources as you progress.
