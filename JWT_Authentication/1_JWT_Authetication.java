Yes, you can implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in a Java Spring Boot application. JWT is a popular way to secure APIs and applications by encoding user claims and information into a compact and self-contained token. Spring Security, a powerful authentication and authorization framework, provides support for integrating JWT authentication in your Spring Boot application.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved in implementing JWT authentication in a Spring Boot application:

1. **Add Dependencies**:
   Add the required dependencies to your `pom.xml` (if you're using Maven) or `build.gradle` (if you're using Gradle). You'll need `spring-boot-starter-security` for Spring Security and `jjwt` for JWT token creation and validation.

2. **Configure Spring Security**:
   Create a configuration class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Override the `configure(HttpSecurity http)` method to configure security settings and define which endpoints require authentication.

3. **User Details Service**:
   Implement the `UserDetailsService` interface to load user details from your data source. This is where you fetch user information from your database or other data store.

4. **Authentication Provider**:
   Create an authentication provider that uses the `UserDetailsService` to authenticate users. You'll also need to configure password encoding.

5. **JWT Token Generation and Validation**:
   Create utility classes to handle JWT token creation and validation using libraries like `jjwt`. When a user successfully logs in, generate a JWT token and return it as a response. For incoming requests, validate the JWT token to authenticate users.

6. **Controller Endpoints**:
   Create controller endpoints for user registration, login, and other authentication-related actions. These endpoints will generate JWT tokens upon successful authentication.

7. **Security Configuration**:
   Configure Spring Security to use JWT-based authentication. Set up a filter to intercept incoming requests, validate the JWT token, and set the authentication in the security context.

Here's a simplified example of how a Spring Boot application might look when implementing JWT authentication:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    
    @Autowired
    private UserDetailsService userDetailsService;
    
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/register", "/login").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .addFilter(new JwtAuthenticationFilter(authenticationManager()))
            .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService).passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());
    }
    
    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified example, and actual implementation might include additional features such as refresh tokens, token expiration, user roles, and more. It's recommended to follow proper security practices and consult the Spring Security documentation for more in-depth guidance.
