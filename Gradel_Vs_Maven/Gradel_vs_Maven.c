Gradle and Maven are both popular build automation and project management tools used in the Java ecosystem. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them often depends on your project's requirements and your personal preferences. Here's a comparison of Gradle and Maven, along with their pros and cons:

**Maven:**

**Pros:**
1. **Convention over Configuration:** Maven follows a strict project structure and convention, making it easier for developers to understand the project layout and build process.
2. **Rich Plugin Ecosystem:** Maven has a vast collection of plugins that cover various aspects of the software development lifecycle, such as building, testing, and packaging.
3. **Stable and Mature:** Maven has been around for a longer time, and many projects and organizations have successfully used it for years.
4. **Centralized Repository:** Maven Central Repository is a well-established and widely used repository for sharing and retrieving project dependencies.
5. **XML Configuration:** While some developers find XML configuration verbose, it can be advantageous for maintaining clear and predictable build configurations.

**Cons:**
1. **Rigid Project Structure:** While the strict project structure can be helpful, it can also be limiting for projects with non-standard layouts.
2. **XML Configuration:** Some developers find XML configuration cumbersome and harder to read, especially for larger projects.

**Gradle:**

**Pros:**
1. **Flexible Build Scripts:** Gradle offers a more flexible and expressive build script using Groovy or Kotlin DSL, allowing developers to write concise and readable scripts.
2. **Incremental Builds:** Gradle is designed for efficient incremental builds, which can significantly speed up the build process for larger projects.
3. **Script-Based Configuration:** Gradle build scripts can be treated as code, providing greater flexibility in defining tasks, dependencies, and custom logic.
4. **Powerful Dependency Management:** Gradle offers dependency resolution strategies that allow you to customize how dependencies are resolved, cached, and managed.
5. **Plugin Ecosystem:** Gradle supports plugins from different sources, including Maven Central and its own plugin repository.

**Cons:**
1. **Learning Curve:** Gradles flexibility can also lead to a steeper learning curve, especially for newcomers to build automation.
2. **Relatively Newer:** Gradle is newer compared to Maven, which means it might not have the same level of historical stability and widespread usage.

**Which is Better?**

The decision between Gradle and Maven depends on various factors:

- **Project Complexity:** Gradles flexibility and incremental build capabilities can be beneficial for larger and complex projects. Mavens conventions might suit simpler projects better.
- **Developer Experience:** Developers who are comfortable with Groovy or Kotlin scripting might prefer Gradle's more expressive build scripts.
- **Team Experience:** If your team is already experienced with Maven, it might be more convenient to stick with it. On the other hand, if your team is open to exploring new tools, Gradle could be a good choice.
- **Integration:** Consider how well each tool integrates with your other development tools and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

Ultimately, both Gradle and Maven are powerful tools, and the choice depends on your project's needs, your team's familiarity, and your preference for the build tools features and capabilities.
