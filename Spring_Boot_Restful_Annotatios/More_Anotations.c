Spring Boot provides a set of annotations to aid in the rapid development of applications. These annotations are used to provide metadata about a program, and they do not directly affect the operation of the code they annotate. They are used extensively in the creation of RESTful APIs. Here are some key Spring Boot annotations and their uses:

1. **@SpringBootApplication**: This annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. It is a combination of three annotations - @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan, and @Configuration.

   ```java
   @SpringBootApplication
   public class MyApplication {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **@Configuration**: Class-level annotation used by Spring Containers as a source of bean definitions. It indicates that a class provides Spring Boot application configuration.

   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class AppConfig {
       @Bean
       public MyBean myBean() {
           return new MyBean();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **@ComponentScan**: Used to scan a package for beans. It is used with the @Configuration annotation. We can also specify the base packages to scan for Spring Components.

   ```java
   @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.myapp")
   @Configuration
   public class AppConfig {
       // ...
   }
   ```

4. **@Bean**: Method-level annotation. It tells the method to produce a bean to be managed by the Spring Container.

   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class AppConfig {
       @Bean
       public MyBean myBean() {
           return new MyBean();
       }
   }
   ```

5. **@Component, @Service, @Repository**: These class-level annotations are used to mark a Java class as a bean. The Spring Framework picks up the annotated class during the classpath scan and configures it in the application context as a Spring Bean. @Service is used for classes containing business logic, and @Repository is used for classes performing database access.

   ```java
   @Component
   public class MyComponent {
       // ...
   }
   
   @Service
   public class MyService {
       // ...
   }
   
   @Repository
   public class MyRepository {
       // ...
   }
   ```

6. **@Autowired**: This annotation provides annotation-based autowiring. It is used to autowire the Spring bean on setter methods, instance variables, and constructors.

   ```java
   @Component
   public class MyComponent {
       private MyService myService;
   
       @Autowired
       public MyComponent(MyService myService) {
           this.myService = myService;
       }
   }
   ```

7. **Spring MVC and REST Annotations**: Annotations like @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, and @PatchMapping are used to map web requests to specific handler methods. They are used to create web service endpoints.

   ```java
   @RestController
   public class MyController {
       @GetMapping("/hello")
       public String hello() {
           return "Hello, world!";
       }
   }
   ```

In the context of developing a RESTful API for backend using Spring Boot, these annotations are used to define the structure of the application, configure the Spring Container, and map web requests to specific handler methods. They provide a declarative way of defining the behavior of the application.
