Certainly, let's go through some of the most commonly used Spring Boot annotations in the context of developing a RESTful API for the backend. I'll provide explanations and code samples for each annotation:

1. **@SpringBootApplication:**
   This annotation is a combination of `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, `@ComponentScan`, and `@Configuration`. It's used at the entry point of the application to indicate that it's a Spring Boot application and to enable various Spring Boot features.

   ```java
   @SpringBootApplication
   public class RestfulApiApplication {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(RestfulApiApplication.class, args);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **@RestController:**
   The `@RestController` annotation is a specialized version of `@Controller` that includes `@ResponseBody`. It's used to define RESTful endpoints that return data directly serialized into the HTTP response body.

   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api")
   public class ApiController {
       @GetMapping("/hello")
       public String sayHello() {
           return "Hello, World!";
       }
   }
   ```

3. **@RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, @PatchMapping:**
   These annotations are used to map HTTP requests to specific controller methods. They define the URL paths and HTTP methods that trigger the corresponding method.

   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/books")
   public class BookController {
       @GetMapping("/{id}")
       public ResponseEntity<Book> getBookById(@PathVariable Long id) {
           // Retrieve and return a book by its ID
       }

       @PostMapping
       public ResponseEntity<Book> createBook(@RequestBody Book book) {
           // Create a new book
       }

       @PutMapping("/{id}")
       public ResponseEntity<Book> updateBook(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Book book) {
           // Update an existing book
       }

       @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
       public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteBook(@PathVariable Long id) {
           // Delete a book by its ID
       }
   }
   ```

4. **@RequestBody and @ResponseBody:**
   These annotations are used together to handle request and response bodies in a RESTful API. `@RequestBody` binds the incoming request body to a method parameter, and `@ResponseBody` serializes the return value of a method to the response body.

   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/books")
   public class BookController {
       @PostMapping
       public ResponseEntity<Book> createBook(@RequestBody Book book) {
           // Create a new book using the request body
       }

       @GetMapping("/{id}")
       public ResponseEntity<Book> getBookById(@PathVariable Long id) {
           // Retrieve and return a book by its ID
       }
   }
   ```

5. **@PathVariable:**
   This annotation is used to extract values from the URL path and bind them to method parameters. It's commonly used to capture variables from the URL.

   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/users")
   public class UserController {
       @GetMapping("/{userId}")
       public ResponseEntity<User> getUserById(@PathVariable Long userId) {
           // Retrieve and return a user by their ID
       }
   }
   ```

6. **@RequestParam:**
   The `@RequestParam` annotation is used to extract query parameters from the URL and bind them to method parameters.

   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/books")
   public class BookController {
       @GetMapping("/search")
       public ResponseEntity<List<Book>> searchBooks(@RequestParam String keyword) {
           // Search for books based on the provided keyword
       }
   }
   ```

These are some of the fundamental annotations used when developing a RESTful API using Spring Boot. They help define endpoints, handle request and response data, and map URL paths to controller methods. Remember that these examples are simplified and might require additional configurations and error handling in a real-world application.
