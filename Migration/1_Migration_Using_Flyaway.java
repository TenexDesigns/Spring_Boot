Yes, in Spring Boot, you can manage database schema changes and versioning using a library called "Flyway." Flyway is a database migration tool that allows you to apply incremental changes to your database schema over time, similar to the concept of migrations in frameworks like Rails and Django.

Flyway provides a structured way to evolve your database schema, making it more maintainable and version-controlled. Here's how you can use Flyway in a Spring Boot project:

1. **Add Flyway Dependency**:
   Include the Flyway dependency in your `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` file, depending on whether you're using Gradle or Maven as your build tool.

2. **Create Migration Scripts**:
   Create SQL migration scripts in your project's resources folder (usually under `src/main/resources/db/migration`). Each script should be named in a specific format, such as `V1__Create_table.sql`, where `V1` indicates the version of the script.

3. **Apply Migrations Automatically**:
   Spring Boot, when integrated with Flyway, will automatically run the pending migration scripts on startup. This ensures that your database schema evolves as your application evolves.

4. **Version Control Integration**:
   Since migration scripts are SQL files, you can version control them along with your code, ensuring that changes to the schema are properly tracked and documented.

Here's a basic example of how your `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file might look when configuring Flyway in a Spring Boot project:

```properties
# application.properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=secret

# Enable Flyway
spring.flyway.enabled=true
spring.flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration
```

With Flyway, as your project progresses, you create new migration scripts whenever you need to modify the database schema. Flyway keeps track of which scripts have been applied and ensures that they are executed in the correct order.

By using Flyway, you can maintain a consistent and reliable way of managing database schema changes in your Spring Boot applications, similar to the migrations concept in other frameworks like Rails and Django.
