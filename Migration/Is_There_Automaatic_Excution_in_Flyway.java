Unlike Rails or Django, Flyway does not automatically generate migration scripts based on changes in your Java code. In Flyway, you need to create migration scripts manually. Each script corresponds to a specific database schema change, and Flyway applies these scripts in the order defined by their version numbers.

Here's how the process works:

1. **Manual Creation of Migration Scripts**:
   When you want to make a change to your database schema, you need to create a new SQL migration script manually. This script defines the exact changes you want to apply, such as creating or altering tables, adding or modifying columns, etc.

2. **Version Numbering**:
   Each migration script is given a version number. This number is used by Flyway to determine the order in which scripts are executed. You typically start with `V1` for the initial script and increment the version number for each subsequent change.

3. **Managing Script Files**:
   Migration scripts are organized in the project's resources directory (e.g., `src/main/resources/db/migration`). You need to manage these script files and ensure that they are created and named properly.

4. **Automatic Execution**:
   When your Spring Boot application starts up, if Flyway is enabled, it automatically scans the migration script locations and executes the scripts that haven't been applied yet. Flyway tracks which scripts have been executed in a special metadata table in the database.

So, unlike Rails or Django, Flyway does not generate migration scripts based on changes in your Java code. You need to write the SQL migration scripts yourself. This manual approach gives you more control over the database schema changes and ensures that you're aware of the changes being made to your database.

If you're looking for an automatic migration generation approach similar to Rails or Django, you might want to explore tools like Liquibase, which can generate migration scripts based on changes to your entity classes. However, note that the approach and philosophy of managing database changes might differ between these tools and frameworks.
