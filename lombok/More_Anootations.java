Your `Book` model already includes some Lombok annotations and JPA annotations for entity mapping. Adding further annotations can enhance the model's functionality, validation, and database representation. Here are a few more annotations you could consider adding to your `Book` model:

1. **`@Id`**: This annotation specifies that the `id` field is the primary key of the entity.

2. **`@GeneratedValue`**: Used along with `@Id`, this annotation configures how the primary key values are generated. Common strategies include `GenerationType.IDENTITY` for auto-incrementing primary keys.

3. **`@Column`**: You can use this annotation to customize column properties like name, length, and nullable. It can also be used to map field names to different column names in the database.

4. **`@NotNull` / `@NonNull`**: These annotations can be used to mark fields as not nullable, helping to ensure that valid data is always present.

5. **`@NotBlank`**: From the Hibernate Validator library, this annotation ensures that the annotated String is not `null` and the trimmed length is greater than zero.

6. **`@Min` / `@Max`**: These annotations can be used to specify minimum and maximum values for numeric fields.

7. **`@Size`**: Specifies the size range for a field, often used with strings to define the minimum and maximum length.

8. **`@JsonIgnore`**: Used to prevent certain fields from being serialized/deserialized when converting the object to/from JSON. Useful for fields that are not meant to be exposed externally.

9. **`@Transient`**: Indicates that a field should not be persisted in the database.

Here's an example of how you might incorporate some of these annotations into your `Book` model:

```java
@Data
@Entity
@Slf4j
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Table(name = "Books")
public class Book {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @NotBlank
    private String title;

    @NotBlank
    private String author;

    private Double price;

    @NotNull
    @Min(0)
    private Integer stock;

    @Transient
    private boolean inStock; // This field won't be persisted in the database

    // Other constructors, methods, etc.
}
```

Remember that the choice of annotations and their configuration depends on your specific requirements. The annotations listed above can help ensure data integrity, improve validation, and provide better control over how your `Book` objects are persisted and used in your application.
