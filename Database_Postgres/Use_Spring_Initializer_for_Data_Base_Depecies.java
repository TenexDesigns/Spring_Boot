In Spring Initializer (https://start.spring.io/), you can set up various configurations for your Spring Boot project, including database connectivity. Here's what you can do in Spring Initializer to set up the database connection and the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

1. **Database Connection in Spring Initializer:**
   In Spring Initializer, you can set up your database connection details by selecting the appropriate options in the "Dependencies" section. When you choose a database-related dependency, Spring Initializer will automatically add the required configuration properties to your project's `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

   For example, if you want to set up a PostgreSQL database connection, you can choose the "Spring Data JPA" dependency, which includes the necessary components for JPA (Java Persistence API) and database connectivity. This will set up the required properties like `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, `spring.datasource.password`, etc., in your configuration file.

   However, you wont find a specific option to configure database connection details directly within the Spring Initializer UI for every database type. More advanced configuration, such as selecting a specific database driver or tweaking connection pool settings, might need to be done directly in the generated project's configuration files.

2. **SQL vs. NoSQL Databases:**
   SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are two distinct types of databases with different data models and characteristics.

   - **SQL Databases:**
     SQL databases are relational databases that store data in structured tables with rows and columns. They use a fixed schema to define the structure of data and support powerful querying capabilities using SQL.
   
   - **NoSQL Databases:**
     NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in flexible, schema-less formats. They are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and can be categorized into various types like document stores (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), column-family stores (e.g., Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).

3. **Spring Initializer for NoSQL Databases:**
   Spring Initializer offers various dependencies for different database technologies, including NoSQL databases. For example, you can select the "Spring Data MongoDB" dependency to set up MongoDB connectivity or choose the "Spring Data Redis" dependency for Redis.

   Similar to setting up SQL database connections, these dependencies will include the necessary configurations in your project's configuration file for the specific NoSQL database you choose.

In summary, while you can set up basic database connection details (such as choosing the database-related dependencies) in Spring Initializer, more specific configurations might require direct adjustments in the generated project's configuration files. When it comes to NoSQL databases, Spring Initializer also provides options for setting up connectivity for different NoSQL database types like MongoDB and Redis.
