Yes, you can remove the Spring Security dependency from your Spring Boot project to completely remove the security-related features, including the need for authorization and authentication. This can be useful when you are in the development phase and want to focus on building and testing your REST API without any security restrictions.

Here's how you can remove the Spring Security dependency:

1. **Remove the Dependency**:
   In your project's `pom.xml` (if you're using Maven) or `build.gradle` (if you're using Gradle), locate the Spring Security dependency and remove or comment it out.

For Maven:

```xml
<!-- Remove or comment out the Spring Security dependency -->
<!-- <dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency> -->
```

For Gradle:

```groovy
// Remove or comment out the Spring Security dependency
// implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'
```

2. **Clean and Rebuild**:
   After removing the dependency, you should clean and rebuild your project to ensure that the changes take effect.

3. **Remove Security Configuration (Optional)**:
   If you have previously added any security configuration classes, you can remove them as well.

Removing the Spring Security dependency will effectively disable all security-related features, including authentication and authorization. This can be convenient during the development phase, but it's important to remember that security is a critical aspect of production applications. Therefore, when preparing to deploy your application to a production environment, you should revisit security requirements and configure Spring Security appropriately to ensure the protection of your application and its resources.
