To complete the remaining CRUD operations (update and delete) for your Spring Boot REST API, you can implement the following methods in your `EmployeeController` class:

1. Update Employee:
```java
@PutMapping("/employees/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<String> updateEmployee(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Employee updatedEmployee) {
    Employee employee = employeeRepository.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Employee of id " + id + " not found"));

    // Update the employee properties
    employee.setFirstName(updatedEmployee.getFirstName());
    employee.setLastName(updatedEmployee.getLastName());
    // Update other properties as needed

    Employee savedEmployee = employeeRepository.save(employee);

    return ResponseEntity.ok("Employee updated successfully");
}
```

2. Delete Employee:
```java
@DeleteMapping("/employees/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<String> deleteEmployee(@PathVariable Long id) {
    Employee employee = employeeRepository.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Employee of id " + id + " not found"));

    employeeRepository.delete(employee);

    return ResponseEntity.ok("Employee deleted successfully");
}
```

In addition to implementing the remaining CRUD operations, here are some ways to improve your code and follow best practices when building a REST API using Spring Boot:

1. Use Response DTOs: Instead of returning the entity objects directly, consider using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to encapsulate the response data. This allows you to control the data that is exposed to the clients and decouples the internal representation of the data from the API.

2. Use appropriate HTTP status codes: Return the appropriate HTTP status codes in your API responses to indicate the success or failure of the operation. For example, use `201 Created` for successful resource creation, `200 OK` for successful retrieval, `204 No Content` for successful deletion, and `400 Bad Request` for invalid requests.

3. Implement error handling: Use exception handling to handle errors and provide meaningful error messages to the clients. Create custom exception classes for different types of errors and handle them using `@ExceptionHandler` methods in your controller.

4. Implement pagination and sorting: If your API returns a large number of resources, consider implementing pagination and sorting to improve performance and usability. Use query parameters to allow clients to specify the page size, page number, and sorting criteria.

5. Use proper naming conventions: Follow standard naming conventions for your classes, methods, and variables. Use meaningful names that accurately describe the purpose and functionality of each component.

6. Implement input validation: Validate the input data to ensure that it meets the required criteria. Use validation annotations or custom validation logic to enforce data integrity and prevent invalid data from being processed.

7. Implement security measures: Depending on the sensitivity of your data, consider implementing security measures such as authentication and authorization to protect your API endpoints. Use Spring Security or other security frameworks to secure your API.

These are some general best practices to consider when building a REST API using Spring Boot. Remember to adapt them to your specific requirements and follow the principles of clean code and good software design.
