Sure, I'll provide you with the implementation of the remaining methods (update and delete) and suggest some improvements and best practices for your Spring Boot REST API code:

1. **Update Employee:**

```java
@PutMapping("/employees/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<String> updateEmployee(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Employee updatedEmployee) {
    Employee existingEmployee = employeeRepository.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Employee of id " + id + " not found"));

    existingEmployee.setFirstName(updatedEmployee.getFirstName());
    existingEmployee.setLastName(updatedEmployee.getLastName());
    // You can update other fields as needed

    employeeRepository.save(existingEmployee);
    return ResponseEntity.ok("Employee updated successfully");
}
```

2. **Delete Employee:**

```java
@DeleteMapping("/employees/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<String> deleteEmployee(@PathVariable Long id) {
    Employee employee = employeeRepository.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Employee of id " + id + " not found"));

    employeeRepository.delete(employee);
    return ResponseEntity.ok("Employee deleted successfully");
}
```

3. **Code Improvements and Best Practices:**

   - **Validation Improvement:** Instead of manually checking if both `firstName` and `lastName` are `null`, consider using proper validation annotations. Use `@NotNull` for fields that cannot be null.

   - **ResponseEntity Usage:** For consistent responses, consider using `ResponseEntity` with proper HTTP status codes and response messages.

   - **Service Layer:** Consider separating your business logic from the controller. Create a service layer to encapsulate your business logic and interact with the repository.

   - **Exception Handling:** Centralize exception handling using `@ControllerAdvice` to handle different exceptions gracefully and return appropriate responses.

   - **DTOs:** Consider using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to map incoming JSON to Java objects. This can help isolate your entity model from your API contract.

   - **Pagination:** For large datasets, consider adding pagination to your GET methods to avoid returning all records at once.

   - **HATEOAS:** Implement Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) to provide links to related resources in your API responses.

   - **Security:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms if your API requires them.

   - **Logging:** Use logging to track API requests, errors, and other important events.

   - **API Versioning:** Plan for API versioning early on to handle changes without breaking existing clients.

Remember that these suggestions are not exhaustive, and best practices can evolve over time. Adapt the suggestions based on your project's specific requirements and needs.
