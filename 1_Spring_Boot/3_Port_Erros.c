The error message youre encountering indicates that the Spring Boot application failed to start because the port 8080, which the application is configured to use, is already in use by another process. To resolve this issue, you need to identify the process using port 8080 and either stop it or configure your Spring Boot application to use a different port.

Here are the steps you can take to resolve this:

1. **Identify the Process Using Port 8080:**
   - On Windows, you can open the Command Prompt and use the command `netstat -ano | findstr :8080` to find the process ID (PID) using port 8080.
   - On macOS or Linux, you can use the command `lsof -i :8080` to find the process using port 8080.

2. **Stop the Process Using Port 8080:**
   - If the process using port 8080 is not needed, you can stop it. On Windows, you can use the command `taskkill /F /PID <PID>` to forcefully kill the process. On macOS or Linux, you can use `kill <PID>`.

3. **Configure Spring Boot to Use a Different Port:**
   - Open the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file in your Spring Boot project.
   - Add or modify the property `server.port` to specify a different port. For example, `server.port=8081` would configure the application to use port 8081.

Heres an example of how you can configure a different port in the `application.properties` file:

```properties
# application.properties

server.port=8081
```

After making this change, save the file and try running your Spring Boot application again. It should start without any port conflicts.

Remember that if youre using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, they might also use ports for running applications. Make sure to check if any running applications or tools within your IDE might be using the port you're specifying for your Spring Boot application.
