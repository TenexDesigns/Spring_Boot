Absolutely, Id be happy to help you understand Spring Boot and its role in building web applications and REST APIs. Lets start with the basics:

**What is Spring Boot?**
Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the process of building production-ready applications and microservices. It provides an opinionated way to set up and configure Spring-based applications with minimal effort. Spring Boot takes care of many of the underlying configurations, allowing developers to focus on writing application logic rather than dealing with boilerplate code.

**Why Use Spring Boot?**
Spring Boot offers several benefits that make it a popular choice for building Java applications:

1. **Simplified Configuration:** Spring Boot reduces the need for XML-based configuration by using sensible defaults and annotations.
2. **Auto-Configuration:** It automatically configures various components based on the classpath and libraries present, reducing manual configuration.
3. **Embedded Servers:** Spring Boot includes embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, simplifying deployment and testing.
4. **Standalone Applications:** Spring Boot applications can be run as standalone JAR files, making deployment easier.
5. **Dependency Management:** It provides a built-in mechanism to manage project dependencies, avoiding version conflicts.
6. **Production-Ready Features:** Spring Boot offers production-ready features like health checks, metrics, security, and more.
7. **Microservices Support:** Its well-suited for building microservices due to its lightweight and modular nature.

**Do You Need Spring Boot?**
You can certainly build web applications and REST APIs without Spring Boot using the core Spring framework (Spring MVC or other components). However, Spring Boot streamlines the process, reduces boilerplate, and provides conventions that can accelerate development and enhance maintainability.

**How Does Spring Boot Work?**
Spring Boot uses the concept of "convention over configuration" to minimize the amount of code you need to write. It provides a set of starter dependencies for various functionalities (e.g., web, data access, security), which are included in your project as needed. These starters include default configurations, but you can customize them according to your requirements. Spring Boot also offers the Spring Boot Starter Parent POM, which helps manage project dependencies and versions.

**Goals of Spring Boot:**
1. **Get Started Quickly:** Spring Boot aims to make it easy for developers to start new projects without spending time on configuration.
2. **No Code Generation:** It avoids generating code and focuses on convention-based configuration.
3. **Opinionated Defaults:** Spring Boot provides sensible defaults, but you can override them when needed.
4. **Production-Ready:** It offers production-ready features out of the box, such as metrics, health checks, and security.
5. **Minimal Spring Configuration:** Spring Boot reduces the amount of Spring configuration needed, promoting concise code.
6. **Microservices-Friendly:** It supports building microservices by offering a lightweight and modular architecture.

**Comparison: Spring Boot vs. Spring MVC vs. Spring:**

1. **Spring:** The core Spring framework provides a wide range of functionalities, including dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and data access. It serves as the foundation for other Spring projects.

2. **Spring MVC:** Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework within the Spring ecosystem for building web applications. It focuses on handling HTTP requests, managing controllers, views, and handling user interactions.

3. **Spring Boot:** Spring Boot simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring-based applications. Its not a replacement for Spring MVC or other Spring projects; instead, it enhances the development experience by providing opinionated defaults and auto-configuration.

Heres a simple example of a Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API using Spring Web:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}

@RestController
class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

In this example, the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation combines multiple annotations, including component scanning and auto-configuration. The `@RestController` annotation defines a simple controller that handles requests to the "/hello" endpoint.

Remember that Spring Boot is about streamlining the setup and configuration process. This example demonstrates the simplicity it brings to building a basic REST API.
