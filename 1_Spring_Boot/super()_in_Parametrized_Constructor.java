In the context of a Spring Boot RESTful project, the `super()` call in a constructor is used to invoke the constructor of the parent class (superclass). It's important to note that if you don't explicitly include a `super()` call in your constructor, Java automatically inserts an implicit call to the superclass's no-argument constructor as the first statement in your subclass constructor.

In the code snippet you provided, the `super()` call is present in the parameterized constructor of the `Book` class. Assuming that `Book` is a subclass of another class (perhaps a base entity class), the `super()` call in this context is likely calling the no-argument constructor of the superclass. This is often used to ensure that any initialization or setup defined in the superclass's constructor is executed before the subclass's constructor logic.

Here's a breakdown of the constructor:

```java
public Book() {
    // No-argument constructor
}

public Book(long id, String firstName, String lastName, String emailId) {
    super(); // Calls the no-argument constructor of the superclass (if applicable)
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.emailId = emailId;
}
```

In this case, the `super()` call is redundant, assuming that the superclass's no-argument constructor doesn't contain any specific logic you need to invoke. If the superclass does have a parameterized constructor or requires specific initialization, you might need to provide appropriate arguments to the `super()` call.

Remember that if you don't explicitly include a `super()` call, Java automatically inserts a call to the superclass's no-argument constructor as the first statement in the subclass's constructor.

For example, if your `Book` class is extending another class named `Parent`, and the `Parent` class has a no-argument constructor like this:

```java
public class Parent {
    public Parent() {
        // Some initialization logic for the Parent class
    }
}
```

Then, when you create an instance of `Book` using the parameterized constructor, the superclass's no-argument constructor will be automatically invoked, ensuring that any necessary setup defined in the `Parent` class is executed before the logic in the `Book` class constructor.

```java
Book book = new Book(1L, "John", "Doe", "john@example.com");
```

To summarize, the use of `super()` in your constructor helps ensure proper initialization of both the subclass and its superclass if required, but in the case of a no-argument superclass constructor, it might be unnecessary and can usually be omitted.
