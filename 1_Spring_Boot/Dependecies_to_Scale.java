The dependencies you choose for your Spring Boot application to enable scalability depend on the specific requirements and architecture of your application. However, here are some common dependencies and technologies that can help you build scalable Spring Boot applications:

1. **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka**: Eureka is a service discovery and registration framework that enables dynamic scaling and load balancing of microservices. It allows services to discover each other and balance the load among multiple instances. This is particularly useful in a microservices architecture.

2. **Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul**: These libraries provide API gateways that can handle routing, load balancing, and filtering of requests to different services. They are useful for managing incoming requests and distributing them to different instances of services.

3. **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer**: This library provides a client-side load balancer that works well with Eureka for distributing requests across multiple instances of a service.

4. **Spring Cache**: Spring Boot provides caching support that can help reduce the load on your database and improve response times. Caching can be used to store frequently accessed data in memory.

5. **Redis or Memcached**: These in-memory data stores can be used for caching purposes and as distributed data stores. They are useful for storing session data, caching, and other data that needs to be quickly accessible.

6. **Spring WebFlux (Reactive Programming)**: If your application has high concurrency requirements, Spring WebFlux and reactive programming can help manage a large number of concurrent requests without tying up threads.

7. **Message Brokers (RabbitMQ, Kafka)**: Message brokers enable asynchronous communication between services, which can help offload heavy processing and improve the scalability of your application.

8. **Spring Cloud Config**: This library enables centralized configuration management for your microservices, making it easier to scale and deploy services with different configurations.

9. **Spring Boot Actuator**: Actuator provides endpoints for monitoring and managing your Spring Boot application. It can help you monitor application health, performance, and other metrics as you scale.

10. **Spring Data Redis**: If you're using Redis, Spring Data Redis provides a convenient way to interact with Redis data structures.

11. **Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin**: These libraries provide distributed tracing capabilities, allowing you to monitor requests across different services and identify performance bottlenecks.

12. **Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker (Hystrix)**: This library provides circuit-breaking capabilities to prevent cascading failures when one service experiences issues. It can help maintain the overall availability of your application.

Remember that the choice of dependencies should be based on your application's requirements, architecture, and scalability goals. Spring Boot provides a wide range of libraries and tools to help you build scalable applications, and you can choose the ones that best fit your needs.
