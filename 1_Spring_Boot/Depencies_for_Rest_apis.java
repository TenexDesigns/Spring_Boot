For building microservices and web APIs using Spring Boot, you'll need a combination of dependencies that provide the necessary features for creating, scaling, and managing microservices. Here are some common dependencies you might consider:

1. **Spring Boot Starter Web**: This starter includes everything you need to build a web-based application, including Spring MVC for creating RESTful APIs.

2. **Spring Boot Starter Data JPA** or **Spring Boot Starter Data R2DBC**: Depending on whether you're using relational databases or reactive databases, you'll need one of these starters for data access.

3. **Spring Boot Starter Validation**: This starter provides support for validation annotations like `@NotNull`, `@NotBlank`, etc., which are important for validating incoming data in your API.

4. **Spring Boot Starter Actuator**: This starter adds production-ready features like monitoring, metrics, health checks, and more.

5. **Spring Boot Starter Security**: If you need authentication and authorization for your microservices, you'll need this starter.

6. **Spring Boot Starter Cloud Eureka (Optional)**: If you're building microservices and need service discovery and load balancing, you might use Eureka as part of Spring Cloud.

7. **Spring Boot Starter Cloud Gateway (Optional)**: If you need API routing and gateway functionality, you might use Spring Cloud Gateway.

8. **Spring Boot Starter Cloud Config (Optional)**: If you're building microservices and want centralized configuration management, you might use Spring Cloud Config.

9. **Spring Boot Starter Cloud Stream (Optional)**: If you're dealing with event-driven architecture, Spring Cloud Stream can help you build messaging-based microservices.

10. **Spring Boot Starter Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin (Optional)**: For distributed tracing and monitoring across microservices, you might use these starters.

11. **Spring Boot Starter Test**: For writing unit and integration tests for your microservices.

12. **Spring Boot DevTools**: Provides development-time features like automatic restart, live reload, etc.

13. **Database Driver Dependencies**: Depending on the database you're using, you'll need to include the appropriate database driver dependency (e.g., H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

14. **Reactive Dependencies (Optional)**: If you're building reactive microservices, you'll need reactive dependencies such as `spring-boot-starter-webflux` and reactive database drivers (like R2DBC).

Remember, the specific dependencies you choose will depend on your project requirements and the architecture you're building. You can start with the basics and gradually add more dependencies as needed for your microservices and APIs. It's also a good idea to explore Spring Cloud for additional features that help with building scalable and resilient microservices architectures.
